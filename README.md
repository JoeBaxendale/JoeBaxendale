Currently looking for jobs in software engineering


Linked below are some examples of my work during my 3 year course


BT data visualisation repo : https://github.com/JoeBaxendale/project-3b - Created 2021

During my final year on the course, we created a bespoke react component in the form of a Gantt chart. This chart would take data parsed in from an API and display it as long as it was parsed in the correct format. Throughout this project we also packaged a number of deliverables such as a set of documentation, a CI/CD pipeline and additional testing and implementation assistance.
